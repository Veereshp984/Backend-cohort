# Day 5 – Backend Development 🚀

## Overview

On **Day 5** of backend learning, I explored **HTTP status codes** and practiced building basic **APIs**. I also set up **MongoDB** and connected it using **MongoDB Compass**.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. HTTP Status Codes

Learned about different types of status codes and their purposes in API responses:

* **200** – OK
* **201** – Created
* **400** – Bad Request
* **401** – Unauthorized
* **404** – Not Found
* **500** – Internal Server Error

Understood how and when to use proper status codes in APIs.

### 2. API Methods (CRUD Operations)

Created and tested APIs using the following HTTP methods:

* **GET** – Fetch data
* **POST** – Create new data
* **PATCH** – Update existing data
* **DELETE** – Remove data

Practiced building routes and handling requests & responses properly.

### 3. MongoDB Setup

* Installed and set up **MongoDB Server**
* Connected the database using **MongoDB Compass**
* Learned how to:

  * Create databases
  * Create collections
  * View and manage documents
